# Your code goes here ...





# Exercise 6: One-to-many association
# We haven't used the Employee class (and employees table) at all yet. If you look at this table's column structure, you'll find that it has a store_id (integer) column. This is a column that identifies which store each employee belongs to. It points to the id (integer) column of their store.

# Let's tell Active Record that these two tables are in fact related via the store_id column.

# Add the following code directly inside the Store model (class): has_many :employees
# Add the following code directly inside the Employee model (class): belongs_to :store
# Add some data into employees. Here's an example of one (note how it differs from how you create stores): @store1.employees.create(first_name: "Khurram", last_name: "Virani", hourly_rate: 60)
# Go ahead and create some more employees using the create method. You can do this by making multiple calls to create (like you have before.) No need to assign the employees to variables though. Create them through the @store# instance variables that you defined in previous exercises. Create a bunch under @store1 (Burnaby) and @store2 (Richmond). Eg: @store1.employees.create(...).
# Exercise 7: Validations for both models
# Add validations to two models to enforce the following business rules:
# Employees must always have a first name present
# Employees must always have a last name present
# Employees have a hourly_rate that is a number (integer) between 40 and 200
# Employees must always have a store that they belong to (can't have an employee that is not assigned a store)
# Stores must always have a name that is a minimum of 3 characters
# Stores have an annual_revenue that is a number (integer) that must be 0 or more
# BONUS: Stores must carry at least one of the men's or women's apparel (hint: use a custom validation method - don't use a Validator class)
# Ask the user for a store name (store it in a variable)
# Attempt to create a store with the inputted name but leave out the other fields (annual_revenue, mens_apparel, and womens_apparel)
# Display the error messages provided back from ActiveRecord to the user (one on each line) after you attempt to save/create the record
